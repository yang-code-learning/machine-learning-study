# Introduction

### 1 What is machine learning

- **Definition**: 
  - Arthur Samuel: learn without being explicitly programmed
  - Tom Mitchell: learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P
- **Algorithms**:
  - Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning
  - Reinforcement learning, recommender systems

### 2 Supervised learning

- **Example**:
  - House price prediction, a **regression** problem: predict real-valued output.
  - Breast cancer,  a **classification** problem: predict discrete valued output.
